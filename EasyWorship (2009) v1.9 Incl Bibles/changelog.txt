NEW Build 1.9 adds support for Microsoft PowerPoint 2010 32 bit.

NOTE Build 1.9 will not support PowerPoint 64 bit edition.
(Having 64 bit Office provides no additional function except the ability to work with files larger than 2 Gigabytes.)
(64 bit Office is not installed by default when installing it. You have to manually install Office 64 bit.)

NOTE PowerPoint viewer 2010 will not be able to loop slideshows (for example announcement loops).
(This is a PowerPoint viewer 2010 bug and will be fixed when Microsoft fixes it. PowerPoint 2010 application is not affected by this.)

NOTE PowerPoint viewer 2010 does not deploy with build 1.9. You can download it from the following link.
